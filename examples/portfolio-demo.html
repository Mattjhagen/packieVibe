      Creating a 3-page portfolio site with a contact form involves several stages of planning, designing, and coding. Since OpenAI model can't directly create interactive websites, it does not have the ability to design and produce visual content. However, I can certainly walk you through it! **Page 1: Home Page** This page would ideally include your name, a brief introduction, and a visually appealing display. This could include a slideshow of your work, your picture, or a clean, eye-catching design that stands out to visitors. HTML structure can be: ```html 
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html> 
        
        <head> 
          
          <title>My Portfolio</title> 
        
        </head> 
        
        <body> <!-- Header Section --> <header>
          <h1>Welcome to My portfolio</h1> <p>This is a brief introduction about me</p> </header> <!-- Main Content Section --> <main> <!-- Code for your slideshow or display here --> </main> </body> </html> ``` **Page 2: Portfolio Page** This page will showcase your best work. Include a brief context statement about each piece that discusses the purpose and result of your effort. HTML structure for this page can be: ```html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Portfolio</title> </head> <body> <!-- Portfolio Section --> <section> <h2>My Projects</h2> <article> <h3>Project 1</h3> <p>Description about project 1</p> </article> <article> <h3>Project 2</h3> <p>Description about project 2</p> </article> </section> </body> </html> ``` **Page 3: Contact Page** A contact page will allow potential employers or collaborators to reach out to you. A basic contact form might include fields for name, email, and a message. HTML structure for this page: ```html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Contact Me</title> </head> <body> <form action="submit_form.php" method="post"> <label for="name">Name:</label><br> <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br> <label for="email">Email:</label><br> <input type="text" id="email" name="email"><br> <label for="message">Message:</label><br> <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea><br> <input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> </body> </html> ``` Please note that you also need to create a `submit_form.php` file for the form to work. Further, you also need to add proper styling to your pages using CSS in `<style>` tags in `head` or linking an external .css file. The ideal way would be to work with a real web developer/designer to create a visually appealing and functioning portfolio site. Please keep in mind that actual web development involves more complex techniques and practices such as responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and much more. The given examples here are quite simplified for illustrative purposes.</pre></body></html>
